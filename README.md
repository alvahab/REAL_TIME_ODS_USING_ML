# REAL_TIME_ODS_USING_ML
Is a main project on Artificial Intelligence, is to explore different methods for helping computers interpret the real world visually, investigate solutions to those methods offered by the open-sourced computer vision library, OpenCV to implement application for detecting and keeping track of objects. Real time object detection using deep learning and OpenCV to work with video streams and video files is provide features to identify the different kinds of objects and gives good performance for Classification/identification of moving object for variety of object classes.
